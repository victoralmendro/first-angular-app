# First Angular Project

This project was based on [Eduardo Pires - Desenvolvimento SPA com Angular](https://desenvolvedor.io/curso-online-desenvolvimento-spa-com-angular) course.

## Goals
- Undestand the principles of the framework
- Create a simple page to demonstrate the content learned

## Dependencies
The package [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) was used to create a simple fake database, so we can see some real data on the products page.

The file name used as `database` is `products.json`

## Running the Project
Use this command to initiate the db:
`npx json-server --watch products.json`

Use this command to start Angular server:
`ng s`
